SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
We have collected publicly available data on SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches and built a machine learning model to predict, with some certainty, whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. This means the company will reuse the first stage and reduce cost. This was achieved though the following:
